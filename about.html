                <img src="img/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Sup, the name's Donald. I am currently attending York County School of Technology as a freshman. I like playing video games, programming and working out in my spare time, as well as listening to music. Also, i am definitely not wanted by the fbi for tax fraud. Anyone who tells you otherwise probably fell off the wrong side of the bed this morning.</p>

                <h2>How did Get To School come to be?</h2>
                <p>I got the idea of Get To School one day when i had just gotten back from doing something that definitely had nothing to do with me and some friends jumping a person who owed us money and was bored. In the future, i plan to go to college to get a bachelor's degree in either Networking and Cyber Security or Programming.</p>
