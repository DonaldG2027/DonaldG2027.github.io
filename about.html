                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Yo, name's Donald. This was a site I made for a game called Get To School my freshman year of high school for my programming class. Ever since then I have grown a significant amount, both physically and mentally. In my technical area we got to pick from 3 of the areas in our technical area to go into for junior and senior year, and i picked Programming as i thought it would be the better choice.</p>

                <h2>What do i do in my freetime?</h2>
                <p>Ever since i made this site, my hobbies have expanded. I joined the football team and I play as a defensive tackle on JV. I also joined the track team, which i do Mid-Distance for. I spend my time playing video games, working out, listening to music, doing homework if i'm not lazy that day, and chilling with friends and family.</p>
