# GET TO SCHOOL 5
The legendary 5th installment in the get to school series.

## What's going on?
To make a long story short, the kid you play as, Reid, is terrible at having a good sleep schedule and ends up missing the bus. Since his parents are done with giving him rides due to how much he misses the bus, he now has to walk to school. Let's hope this boy runs cross country, cause it's gonna be a long day for him!
## FEATURES
- A game bound to keep you and your friends on your screens for hours!
- Cool mechanics!
- Cut scenes!
- *insert other blatant lies here*

NOTE: The scene where Reid sings his beautiful cover of Romantic Homicide by d4vd has been cut due to recent events.

-# side note, how many times am I gonna have to replace these covers? First, I had to remove the one of "It Seems Like You're Ready" after this girl looked at me weird when I played the cover for her, then I had to replace "I'll Be Missing You" after Diddy's arrest, and now I have to replace d4vd too. What am I supposed to do for the cover now? I'm genuinely out of ideas.
