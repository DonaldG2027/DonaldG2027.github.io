# GET TO SCHOOL 5
The legendary 5th installment in the get to school series.

## What's going on?
To make a long story short, the dude you play as is terrible at having a good sleep schedule and ends up missing the bus. Since his parents are done with giving him rides due to how much he misses the bus, he now has to walk to school. Let's hope this boy runs cross country, cause it's gonna be a long day for him!
